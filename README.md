Machine learning triggering algorithm in Python (TensorFlow 2) for weak and noisy signal from CRES. This version of the algorithm utilizes LSTM units to learn from the chirping signature of CRES signal in Fourier space. MLFlow hyperparameter optimization with multi-GPU parallelization has been added.
